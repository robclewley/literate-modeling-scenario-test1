  difficulty: easy
  time: short
  tags: graphical, ODE

Given:
 - 2D nonlinear vector field given as a black box function of (x,y) -> (fx, fy)
 - finite, rectangular domain [x0,x1] X [y0,y1]
 - Euclidean error tolerance of forward trajectories (chosen to be feasible for the given function f)

Goal:
  - Derive a UAC-satisfying local linear ODE approximation in the domain (where nonlinearity is fairly weak)

UAC:
 - Predict all forward trajectories up to given max tolerance of Euclidean error
