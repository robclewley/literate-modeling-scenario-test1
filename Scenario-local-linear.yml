  name: local linear fit
  difficulty: easy
  time: short
  tags: graphical, ODE

Given:
 - 2D, weakly nonlinear, determininstic vector field given as a black box function of (x,y) -> (f_x(x,y), f_y(x,y))
 - finite, rectangular domain [x0,x1] X [y0,y1]
 - Euclidean error tolerance of forward trajectories (chosen to be feasible for the given function f, unless task scenario is open to being proven inconsistent)

Goal:
  - Derive a UAC-satisfying local linear ODE approximation in the domain (where nonlinearity is fairly weak)

UAC:
 - Predict all forward trajectories up to given max tolerance of Euclidean error
